# RandomSong
picks a random song from your SongList in Audica according to the filter you set (All / Main / Extras)
You can set RandomSongBagSize in ModPrefs. It's the amount of songs the mod will remember. A remembered song will not be picked again.
Don't set it to something higher than the amount of extras-songs (dlc + customs) you have, else it won't work properly. The max. bagsize is 33.
